# Axiom — Mutation Log

## 2026-05-19

- Created `Architecture/Axiom as Verifier.md` as the E7 doctrine anchor: Axiom is the typed translator from JTBD to governed runtime contract, `.truths` is an auditable intermediate, `AxiomRunReport` is a verifier, and the explicit boundaries are no formation selection, no authority recompute, and no specialist hosting.
- Linked the new architecture page from `Home.md` so future Axiom work has a discoverable doctrine target before code follows.
- Expanded the WASM responsibility boundary across `Architecture/WASM Compilation.md`, `Architecture/Converge Contract.md`, `Architecture/Validation Pipeline.md`, `Architecture/API Surfaces.md`, `Philosophy/Truth-Driven Development.md`, and `Architecture/Axiom as Verifier.md`: Axiom produces compiled artifacts and manifests, Helm owns sandbox hosting and plugin lifecycle, and Converge owns governed promotion, stop reasons, and integrity.
- Added cross-references from `Architecture/Axiom as Verifier.md` to the Helm and Converge KB pages that now anchor the WASM sandbox boundary.
- Added `Architecture/Clause IDs and Decoder Spine.md` and enriched the v0.10 milestone with the first-slice decisions: deterministic hierarchical clause IDs, separate text fingerprints, rule-based decoder spine, deferred crate split, overlay-based overrides, and set-valued verifier stop reasons.
- Added the `truth_package` module with `JtbdInput`, `JtbdDocument`, `JtbdClause`, `ClauseId`, `ClauseFingerprint`, `ArtifactLineage`, and `LineageMap` closure checks; documented the public surface in README, API Surfaces, System Overview, INDEX, and JTBD concept docs.
- Extended `truth_package` with `TruthPackage`, `TruthPackageId`, `TruthPackageArtifacts`, `ProofObligation`, `VerifierSpec`, `ReplayProfile`, and deterministic `decode_jtbd(JtbdInput) -> TruthPackage`; added `Concepts/Truth Package.md` as the schema reference and marked the completed v0.10 spine items in `MILESTONES.md`.
- Added generated `.truths` override/version overlays: `TruthProjectionOverlay`, `TruthProjectionVersion`, `TruthProjectionSource`, package-level overlay application, parse/target/source-clause validation, and tests proving overlays do not mutate the deterministic generated package.
- Added the v0.10 `AxiomRunReport` surface with `AxiomRunVerdict`, `ObservedStopReason`, promoted fact records, evidence refs, trace links, and run integrity proof summaries; updated the Truth Package concept doc, KB index, and milestone state.
- Added Axiom's `converge_pack::ProvenanceSource` marker (`AxiomTruth` / `AXIOM_PROVENANCE`), typed `TruthPackageSeedPayload`, Truth Package seed proposal helpers, and an integration test proving Converge promotion preserves the typed Axiom payload while adding evidence refs, trace links, and integrity.
- Closed v0.9/v0.10 milestone state in `MILESTONES.md` and sketched v0.11 around one marquee job run adapter plus computed `AxiomRunReport` verdict.
- Added the round-driven Formation Design marquee fixture from `atelier-showcase`: a compact JTBD, a staged `AxiomRunReport` shape that preserves the design huddle and work Formation boundaries, `tests/round_driven_marquee.rs`, and `Marquee/Round-Driven Formation Design.md`. Noted that the live showcase currently fails to compile because `ConvergenceJudge` and `convergence_reached` are referenced but not defined.
- Folded v0.10 review feedback into the docs and v0.11 plan: documented `JtbdInput::from_metadata(...)` as the legacy JTBD migration bridge, recorded the deterministic expiry sentinel as a v0.11 replacement item, and kept round-driven Formation design as the primary staged verifier proof while tracking an irreversible commitment fixture as the next strict-verdict proof.
- Updated the v0.11 round-driven marquee note from the latest `atelier-showcase` run: origin/main now carries evidence-weighted LLM scoring, the LLM convergence judge, and the platform API migration; the live run converges at round 2, fires the halt marker, skips round 3, and runs the work Formation from the converged shortlist.
- Aligned the round-driven Axiom fixture with the new platform-API markers (`proposer_exclusions_marker`, scorecard, convergence judgment, and halt marker) and added the first v0.11 promoted-fact/staged-observation adapter surface.
- Added the v0.12 milestone direction: an irreversible commitment strict-verdict verifier proof comes before decoder calibration, with ambiguous sensemaking and governed commercial decisioning deferred to the v1.0 proof set.
- Started the v0.12 escrow release fixture proof: documented the irreversible JTBD, added Satisfied/Blocked/Invalid verdict cases, and recorded that the current slice is fixture-backed until a real Tally-style escrow runtime exists.
- Replaced the vague Tally placeholder with the concrete marquee-app sequence: `tally-escrow` for v0.12, followed by `quorum-sense` and `scout-sourcing` for the broader v1.0 proof set.
- Locked the sequence: v0.12 is Tally escrow release; v0.13 is decoder calibration. Added `Architecture/Decoder Calibration.md` and documented the v0.12 report data needed to become future calibration feedstock.
- Started v0.12 implementation by emitting deterministic policy requirement artifacts from the Truth Package decoder and asserting the escrow release commitment envelope covers authority, required evidence, and forbidden failure modes.
- Extended promoted fact report records with optional Converge promotion authority data (gate ID, policy hash, approver) so Axiom reports can show authority was observed at promotion without treating Axiom as the authority source.
- Added the Axiom-side Tally release observation adapter recipe: a local wire-shaped release outcome maps transition truth keys, Organism signing witnesses, custody receipt, idempotency, and observed promotion authority into `AxiomRunObservation`; missing release truth key now produces an `Invalid` verifier result.
- Completed v0.12 by replacing the fixture-only Tally proof with a recorded release transcript, proving the final report carries v0.13 learning feedstock fields, and recording the residual gap from irreversible strict-verdict proof to the v1.0 three-proof set.
- Implemented the v0.13 decoder calibration loop: `LearningEpisode`, `CalibrationKey`, `CalibrationRecord`, `CalibrationTable`, accepted calibration suggestions, and package enrichment via `apply_decoder_calibration(...)`, with tests proving Tally release outcomes produce reviewable priors without pulling Formation selection, authority recompute, or specialist hosting into Axiom.
- Updated `Architecture/Decoder Calibration.md`, `Concepts/Truth Package.md`, and `INDEX.md` to document calibration ownership, persistence shape, review statuses, lineage requirements, and the new public types.
- Added `Architecture/Axiom-Helm-App Contract.md` to make the app-thinning direction explicit: Axiom owns truth packages and verifier learning, Helm owns operator review and sandbox lifecycle, apps own domain state and adapters, and Tally remains the boundary-finding loop before Atlas Integration becomes the next app vertical.
- Ran the first Tally boundary probe against `release-requires-conditions-met`: Tally keeps the strict agreement transition guard, Axiom owns the truth/verifier/calibration expression of release-condition evidence, Helm should own the operator surface for missing evidence and accepted concerns, and Organism/Mosaic/Converge remain runtime capability and promotion boundaries.

## 2026-05-17

- Documented the v0.9 direction: Axiom should become the truth-to-formation run-proof layer that validates `.truths`, compiles `IntentPacket`, calls Organism formation selection/compilation, and reports the Converge fixed-point result.
- Added `Architecture/Truth-to-Formation Run Proof.md` with ownership boundaries, best-of-stack rules, the minimum proof, `AxiomRunReport` shape, and the 2026-05-17 plan.
- Added the first v0.9 fixture proof test: a governed vendor `.truths` source compiles to `IntentPacket`, routes through Organism's `organism-diligence` formation selection, compiles and instantiates fixture Suggestors, and reaches Converge `StopReason::Converged`.
- Published `axiom-truth` 0.8.1 to crates.io after `cargo publish --dry-run --allow-dirty` verified the release package.
- Moved Axiom onto the published upstream release train after Mosaic, Converge, and Organism were advanced: `converge-provider` 3.9.1, `converge-manifold-adapters` 1.1.1, and `organism-pack` 1.9.0.
- Confirmed crates.io search exposes `organism-pack` 1.9.0 and `converge-manifold-adapters` 1.1.1, replacing the previous missing-Organism blocker.
- Reran release checks after the manifest bump: `cargo check --all-targets`, `cargo test`, `cargo package --allow-dirty`, and `cargo package --list --allow-dirty` all passed.
- `cargo package --allow-dirty` packaged 66 files and verified `axiom-truth` 0.8.1 against the published registry path, including `converge-manifold-adapters` 1.1.1 and Organism 1.9.0 crates.
- Ran release-readiness checks for `axiom-truth` 0.8.1: `cargo check --all-targets` passed; `cargo test` passed with 427 lib tests, 2 CLI tests, 4 Converge contract integration tests, and 7 doctests passing.
- Tightened `Cargo.toml` package includes so the crates.io package does not ship local agent configs, CI metadata, or Obsidian workspace state.
- Earlier in the session, adjusted the Manifold dependency to the then-published `converge-manifold-adapters` 1.1.0 requirement while keeping the `llm-all` feature.
- Earlier in the session, confirmed the previous publish blocker: `cargo package --allow-dirty` resolved Manifold but stopped because `organism-pack` 1.8.1 and its 1.8.1 phase crates were not yet published on crates.io.

## 2026-05-15

- Aligned the runtime intent boundary with the Converge 3.9.1 release train: `converge-provider` 3.9.1, published `converge-manifold-adapters` 1.1.0 with `llm-all`, and `organism-pack` 1.8.1.
- Updated the Converge contract note to make the Manifold chat helper feature requirement explicit.

## 2026-05-07

- Added `intent` module — `compile_intent(&TruthDocument) -> IntentPacket` plus `compile_intent_from_source` convenience. Bridge logic moved here from `organism-intent::bridge` (deleted) to invert the dependency arrow: `axiom-truth → organism-pack` instead of `organism → axiom-truth`. 17 tests inline. Axiom now depends on `organism-pack` 1.5.1.
- Updated Architecture/System Overview.md — added `intent` to module map, documented the Runtime Intent pipeline, recorded the new dependency direction.
- Added Architecture/API Surfaces.md — canonical public API reference, including the `.truths` source → `parse_truth_document` → `compile_intent` → `IntentPacket` flow.
- Created Architecture/Intent Compilation.md — full field mapping (Authority/Constraint/Exception → IntentPacket), error model, caller flow.
- Updated top-level `lib.rs` doc comment — added Compiling to runtime intent section with caller example.
- Aligned AGENTS.md, MILESTONES.md, and Justfile workflow recipes to the 0.8.1 surface: `converge-provider` + `converge-manifold-adapters` + `organism-pack`; `just focus`, `just sync`, and `just status` now exist.
- Bumped axiom-truth 0.7.0 → 0.8.1 (new public module + new dep is a minor bump).
